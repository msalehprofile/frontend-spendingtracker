<h1>Spending tracker</h1>
A mobile based budget tracker

<h2>Task</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To create a mobile app where you can create and log into your own account, add spends and get information based on your spending habits back. This is connected to a backend Java project which is in another Repo called "backend-spendingtracker".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When you enter the app you are given two options: Sign up or Log in.</li>
    <li>When you go to sign up you are presented with a form you have to complete in order to create an account, and when you log in you have to enter a valid email and password to be able to get into your account. I have added various checks into the backend to make sure the data entered is valid.</li>
    <li>I wanted the app to be easy to use and clearly laid out. I made a navigation bar at the bottom givin the user four pages to look at:
<ol>
    <li>A trends page where users can see their 5 most recent transaction and they are given a choice as to whether they want to see their spends per day for the current month via a bar graph or how their spending is broken up into categories via a pie chart.</li>
    <li>A budgets page where users can see a more detailed view of how they are tracking via the budgets they have set. There is also a button on this page which takes user to a form where they can update their budgets.</li>
    <li>A form where users can upload a spend to the database, there are backend checks here.</li>
    <li>A profile page where user can log out.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Currently I am having issues with deploying the backend, so although front end is deployed to see, it only fully works locally.</li>
</ul>
